# bf-wasm

Two implementations of Brainfuck, one in JavaScript and one in AssemblyScript, compiled to WASM. Just messing around with AssemblyScript and doing some basic benchmarking. (The JS implementation is faster.)

```
git clone https://github.com/gakimball/bf-wasm
cd bf-wasm
npm i
npm run asbuild
npm start
```
